   <p>Andrew Buchholz, a reporter from Spartanscoop.org, wrote an article in which they discuss the decline in quality of movies over the years. Buchholz mainly focuses on the technical side of film when discussing what changes caused this decrease in quality. They cover the effect streaming services like Netflix had on the film industry, and how the unique ways shots were taken in movies seems to be more rare nowadays. They use the very popular film "Citizen Kane" as an example of a movie that used unique filming techniques and storytelling to captivate their audience. Buchholz goes into more detail about streaming services and unique filming angles throughout the article.</p>
      <p>The main points Buchholz brings up when discussing their view of how streaming services caused the decline in movie quality are the ease in which films can be made by companies like Netfilx or Hulu, and the ease in which movies can be watched at home for little cost compared to movie theatre tickets. According to Buchholz, "Netflix, though, can make a movie in a matter of months and, whether or not it is a success, they have a huge monthly income from their subscribers." Buchholz uses famous film director Quentin Tarantino as an example for unique filming techniques that seem to have vanished over time. "One cinematography tactic he is known for using in a number of his films is the low-angle trunk shot...Plenty of directors nowadays do not seem to consider explorative angles like this." Buchholz believes the creativity of film has dwindled the longer time passes.</p>

   <section id="MyOpinion">
       <p>Buchholz brings up many interesting points when it comes to the decline in film quality. Some points I agree with, such as the impact of streaming services, while others I simply don't know enough about to form an educated opinion. Whatever Buchholz's opinion may be, they presented it in a logical and proper way that successful conveys their own point of view on modern film.</p>
          <p>I agree with the notion that streaming services have encouraged the quantity at which movies are released over the quality, which has very negatively impacted the film industry. If someone were to name the best modern movies, there would probably not be many movies that were created by these streaming services.Similary, it feels like directors rely more on big names in movies, like Marvel, DC, or Star Wars, as opposed to their own talent when it comes to writing and filming, which gives off the idea that perhaps they don't have the talent to make the film their own. As Buchholz says, "To add onto these tired storylines it is rare today to see a movie with new and intriguing framing or unique camera techniques." Movies have become boring, basic, and unoriginal, and its about time for something to change.</p>
